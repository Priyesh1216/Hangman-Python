# Hangman-Python
Hangman Game in Python

- Initially written and tested in Repl.it (online IDE).
- Copied onto GitHub for public display.

The game runs directly through the terminal and features a preloaded selection of words for the classical game of hangman.

1. The goal of Hangman is for the player to determine a secret word by guessing its letters.
2. Initially, the player only knows how many letters are in a word, where each underscore represents a letter in the word.
3. The player guesses one letter at a time, and if that letter is in the secret word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed.
4. If the guessed letter is not in the secret word, that letter is added to a list of incorrect guesses, and a part of the Hangman picture is drawn.
5. If a player can determine the word before making 8 incorrect guesses, the player wins.
